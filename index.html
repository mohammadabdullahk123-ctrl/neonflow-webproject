    <h2>OUR HUMBLE BEGINNINGS</h2>
    <p>NeonFlow Studio was born out of the collaborative vision of three university friends: Alex, Sophie, and Raj. Each one brought their unique skills and background to the table. Alex, a graphic designer with a keen eye for aesthetics, Sophie, a front-end developer with a passion for clean code, and Raj, a full-stack developer focused on backend architecture, realized they had complementary skills that could revolutionize the way websites were built. After working on freelance projects together, they decided to form a company that would focus on delivering high-quality, responsive websites for clients of all sizes.
The name “NeonFlow” came from their shared love of vibrant, bold designs and the idea of a continuous, glowing flow of creativity and technology. They believed that just like neon lights, websites should capture attention and leave a lasting impression.</p>
